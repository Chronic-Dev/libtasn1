Version 0.3.2
- Corrected bug in asn1_der_coding() which overwrited some
  data in the original structure.
- The asn1Parser, asn1Coding and asn1Decoding programs are now installed.

Version 0.3.1
- Support constant size bit strings, as in 'BIT STRING (SIZE(42))'.
  Reported by Cyril Holweck <cyril.holweck@q-free.com>.
- Add two more APIs required by GnuTLS.
- New public APIs:

  asn1_copy_node

Version 0.3.0

  files are included in windows/.
- New public APIs:
  asn1_get_tag_der
  asn1_octet_der
  asn1_get_octet_der
  asn1_bit_der
  asn1_get_bit_der
  asn1_get_length_der
