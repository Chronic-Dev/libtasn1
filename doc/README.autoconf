If you want to use the gnutls library in other projects
using autoconf/aclocal, put in your 

aclocal.m4:
 include(libtasn1.m4)

configure.in:
 AM_PATH_LIBTASN1( 0.2.10,, AC_MSG_ERROR([[
***
*** libtasn1 was not found. You may want to get it from
*** ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/libtasn1/
]]))

these macros define LIBTASN1_LIBS and LIBTASN1_CFLAGS.
