Subject: GNU Libtasn1 2.8 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GNU Libtasn1 is a standalone library written in C for manipulating ASN.1
objects including DER/BER encoding/decoding.  GNU Libtasn1 is used by
GnuTLS to handle X.509 structures and by GNU Shishi to handle Kerberos
V5 structures.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.8 (2010-09-25) [stable]
- Update gnulib files.
- Use Libtool 2.2.10 to ease MinGW64 builds.

Commercial support contracts for Libtasn1 are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libtasn1
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.

For developers interested in improving code quality, we publish
Cyclomatic code complexity charts that help you find code that may
need review and improvements:

Also useful are code coverage charts which indicate parts of the
source code that needs to be tested better by the included self-tests:
